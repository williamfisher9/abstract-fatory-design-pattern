## Abstract Factory Design Pattern
- Factory is a factory of several different objects while an Abstract Factory is a factory of several different factories.
- The Factory pattern deals with creating objects of a single type, while the Abstract Factory pattern deals with creating objects of related types.
- The Factory pattern usually has one Factory class and one interface for the products, while the Abstract Factory pattern has one Abstract Factory interface, multiple concrete Factory classes, and multiple interfaces for the products.
- Each factory class will build an object of differnet related components.
